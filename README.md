The task this week is to complete the following 2 structures using a linked list:StackQueueAssume the occurrence of a linked list node is represented by the object “Node” and its “Data” and “NextRef” attributes.Part 1: Assume a “Head” node exists with the NextRef attribute pointing to the first node in the stack or being null if the stack is empty. Create pseudo code for the following 3 stack methods, showing the logic tied to the inverted list. Include a summary of these actions. push( item )pop( )display( )Part 2: Assume “Front” and “Rear” nodes exist with the “NextRef” attributes pointing to the first and last nodes of the queue or being null if the queue is empty. Create pseudo code for the following 3 queue methods, showing the logic tied to the inverted list. Include a summary of these actions.enqueue( item )dequeue( )display( )
